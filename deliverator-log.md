## deliverator log

27.01.21

- Create-react-apped.
- Wrote down structure and what I need. 
- Decided to go for TDD.
- Installed dependencies, but didn't read the instructions, and had clashing deps. 
- Removed everything and will try again.

28.01.21

- Recreated the app. Checked that it works and the initial test passes. 
  Will now slowly install jest and Enzyme step by step, and not install the TS for now:
  Jest: npm install --save-dev jest
  Enzyme: npm i --save-dev enzyme
  Adapter for React 17: npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17

  React test renderer:  npm i --dev react-test-renderer (react now comes with jest when using cra, so one only needs to add this. Last time I also installed all the babel things I saw in a tutorial which is not up do date, and that clashed with my app)

  In order to configure Enzyme add this to setupTests.js in src (automatically generated by CRA)

  ```react
  import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
  import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';
  
  Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });


  (I commented out the jest import. Not sure if needed to.--->Not if I want to pass the initial test in the App.test.js file, because that uses jest syntax).

  Following YT tutorial step-by-step and so far it's working with the adapter and the scripts in the setupTest.js that I too from another tutorial (on YT they will do it later).

- Started by creating a button on the InputForm component just to see I'm getting my tests right.
  - forgot to import {shallow} from enzyme
  - forgot to export the component function (figured that out after some flailing, when I decided to actually read the error.)
  - Trying to test for the existence of the form, but haven't found right syntax.
  - extracting wrapper and using beforeEach doesn't work..
